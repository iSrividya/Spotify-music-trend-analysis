# 🎵 Spotify Music Trend Analysis — 2023

This project dives into the top streamed tracks of 2023 on Spotify to uncover what makes a song popular. Using audio features like energy, danceability, and acousticness, we identify patterns in listener behavior and track performance.

## 📌 Objective
Explore and analyze the most streamed songs on Spotify in 2023 to answer:
- What audio features drive popularity?
- Which artists and genres dominated the charts?
- How do attributes like tempo, mood, and energy influence user engagement?

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle/Spotify Top 200 2023 dataset]
- Format: Excel (.xlsx)
- Features: Track Name, Artist, Streams, BPM, Key, Loudness, Danceability, Energy, etc.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- Excel (for initial inspection and validation)

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed
- Top artists by total streams
- Relationship between energy/danceability and popularity
- Popularity by release decade
- Audio feature correlation heatmap
- Distribution of acousticness, tempo, and valence

## 📈 Visualizations
- 🔥 Heatmaps of feature correlations
- 📉 Stream counts vs. track attributes
